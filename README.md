ðŸ“Š YouTube Comments & Popularity Analysis
Project Type: SQL Analytics
Environment: SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)
Objective: To explore the relationship between video popularity and the nature of user-generated comments, including sentiment. The goal is to generate actionable insights for content creators and platform strategists.

ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project analyzes YouTube video-level statistics and associated comment data. Using SQL, we explore how user engagement (views, likes, comments) aligns with audience reactions (comment sentiment, comment volume, top-liked comments). The insights help identify what types of content drive engagement and how users emotionally respond to it.

ðŸ“Œ Business Questions & Analytical Focus

1. Which keywords are associated with the highest-performing videos?
Consider analyzing by views, likes, and comments.
Are there common patterns in topics or content types?

```
SELECT 
    Keyword,
    COUNT(*) AS VideoCount,
    SUM(CAST(Views AS FLOAT)) AS TotalViews,
    SUM(CAST(Likes AS FLOAT)) AS TotalLikes,

    (SUM(CAST(Views AS FLOAT)) + 10 * SUM(CAST(Likes AS FLOAT)) + 20 * SUM(CAST(Comments AS FLOAT))) AS PerformanceScore
FROM videos
WHERE Keyword IS NOT NULL AND Keyword <> ''
  AND ISNUMERIC(Views) = 1 AND ISNUMERIC(Likes) = 1 AND ISNUMERIC(Comments) = 1
GROUP BY Keyword
ORDER BY PerformanceScore DESC;

/*2. Do videos with high engagement (likes/views/comments) tend to have more positive, negative, or neutral comments?
Use average sentiment across comments per video.
Do high-performing videos attract more extreme sentiment?*/

Do videos with more comments have more polarized (0 or 2) reactions?
Are neutral comments more common on low-engagement videos?*/
